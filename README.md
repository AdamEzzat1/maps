# Traffic Congestion Visualization Project

This project aims to visualize the traffic congestion in San Francisco, CA, with the goal of helping to identify areas of high congestion and potential solutions to alleviate it. Currently, the project is utilizing the `osmdata` R package to gather data on traffic congestion, but we are actively seeking ways to access more up-to-date and live data.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the data collection phase and we are working on refining our data collection methods. Once we have obtained more live data, we will move on to the next phase of the project, which will involve analyzing and visualizing the data.

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to incorporate statistics on travel times in more congested areas compared to less congested areas. This information will be useful in identifying the areas that need the most attention and finding ways to improve traffic flow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the `osmdata` R package installed. Once you have installed the package, you can start collecting data by running the code provided in the `data_collection.R` file.
